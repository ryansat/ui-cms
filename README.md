# Web Builder with CMS Capabilities

This project extends the standard Vue 3 and Vite setup to introduce CMS capabilities, transforming it into a powerful web builder framework. It leverages Vue 3's reactivity and component model, combined with Vite's modern tooling, to provide a dynamic and user-friendly interface for content management and website construction.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for assembling web components, providing a seamless user experience.
- **CMS Integration**: Easily manage and update content with a built-in CMS, allowing for real-time updates and previews.
- **Component Customization**: Modify and style components directly within the builder for quick iterations and design changes.
- **Responsive Design Tools**: Tools to ensure your web creations are fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- **Live Preview**: Instantly preview changes as you build and edit, ensuring your site looks exactly as intended.
- **Export Capabilities**: Export your layouts and designs as JSON or JPG for easy sharing and collaboration.
